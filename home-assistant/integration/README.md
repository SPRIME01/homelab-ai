# Home Assistant Integration with Triton Inference Server and Ray

This integration connects Home Assistant with Triton Inference Server and Ray for AI-powered home automation. It enables voice command processing, sensor data analysis, and AI-driven automations.

## Components

- **TritonAI Integration**: Custom component for Home Assistant to communicate with Triton Inference Server
- **Ray Task Manager**: Service for distributed AI processing tasks
- **Sensor Data Analysis**: ML-based processing of sensor data
- **AI-Driven Automation**: Intelligent automation rules based on AI predictions

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Home Assistant running in the homelab environment
- Triton Inference Server deployed with necessary models
- Ray cluster set up for distributed processing
- Network connectivity between all components

### Installation Steps

1. Copy the `custom_components/triton_ai` directory to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
2. Copy the configuration files from `config` to your Home Assistant configuration directory
3. Install the Python dependencies in `requirements.txt`
4. Configure the integration in Home Assistant using the UI or by editing `configuration.yaml`
5. Restart Home Assistant to load the integration

### Configuration

Basic configuration in `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
triton_ai:
  triton_url: http://triton-inference-server.ai.svc.cluster.local:8000
  ray_address: ray://ray-head.ai.svc.cluster.local:10001
  models:
    text_generation: llama2-7b
    image_recognition: yolov5
    speech_recognition: whisper-medium
  log_level: info
```

## Usage

### Voice Commands

Voice commands are processed through the voice pipeline. You can use the following patterns:

- "Turn on the lights in the [room]"
- "What's the temperature in the [room]?"
- "Set the thermostat to [temperature]"

### Sensor Analysis

Sensor data is automatically analyzed for patterns and anomalies. The integration will:
- Detect unusual patterns in temperature, humidity, power usage, etc.
- Provide insights about home environment and usage patterns
- Generate predictions for future sensor states

### AI-Driven Automations

Create automations in Home Assistant that use the AI predictions:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Preemptive AC Control"
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.ai_temperature_prediction
    action:
      service: climate.set_temperature
      target:
        entity_id: climate.living_room
      data:
        temperature: "{{ states('sensor.ai_temperature_prediction') }}"
```
